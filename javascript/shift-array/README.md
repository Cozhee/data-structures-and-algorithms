For this challenge we will take an array and a value and then place that value in the middle of the array shifting all values to the right of it.

## Approach
We needed to find the middle index and the last value. This way we could take all the other index and push them right. First we push the other elements to the right and then when that is done we fill in the blank middle space with the value passed to the function.
